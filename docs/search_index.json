By clicking or moving the slider upward to choose different level, we can see each levels winning rate distribution in the histogram below. From the static graph model made by R, we roughly know the distribution of the winning rate in each level including the maximum, minimum and median. While in this D3 graph, by tuning the sliders value, we get a more straightforward view of how distribution changes between levels. We can find the median winning rate increases as the level gets higher, the proportion of 0 winning rate gets smaller as the level gets higher, while the proportion of 100% winning rate gets larger.
